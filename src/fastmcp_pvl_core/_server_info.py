"""Reusable ``get_server_info`` tool factory.

Lets domain MCP servers register a single tool that reports both the
wrapper's own version (``server_version``) and, optionally, the upstream
service's version.  This is the one-call sanity check operators want when
verifying that a fresh image is actually serving traffic — see issue #17
for the motivating story (a ``docker pull`` without rebuild leaving an
old image up).

The tool's default description reaches the model on every downstream's
server; how FastMCP builds it and how clients read it is in
``docs/reference/mcp-model-facing-text.md``.

    The registered tool is read-only and returns a structured payload::

        {

          "server_version": "<server_version>",

        }

    If the upstream lookup raises, the upstream block becomes
    ``{"error": "<message>"}`` so the tool still returns the wrapper info
    instead of failing the whole call. The message is the exception's, with
    every URL's userinfo, query and fragment removed: an HTTP client's
    error quotes the request URL, and an operator's upstream URL may carry
    credentials.

    Args:
        mcp: The :class:`FastMCP` instance to register on.
        server_version: The wrapper's own version (typically the domain
            project's ``__version__``).
        server_name: The wrapper's package/distribution name (e.g.
            ``"paperless-mcp"``).
        upstream_version: Optional zero-arg callable (sync or async)
            returning a dict (full upstream block), ``None``, or any other
            value (coerced via ``str()`` and wrapped as
            ``{"version": "<str>"}``).
        upstream_label: Key under which the upstream block appears in the
            response.  Defaults to ``"upstream"``.  Must not collide with
            the reserved keys ``server_name``, ``server_version``, or
            ``core_version``; this is validated eagerly at registration
            time, even when ``upstream_version`` is ``None``.  When no
            provider is configured the label is otherwise unused — no
            block keyed under it appears in the payload.
        tool_name: Tool name to register.  Defaults to ``"get_server_info"``.
        description: Override for the tool description.  Defaults to a
            built-in description that mentions the wrapper name.  Pass
            ``""`` to register an empty description; only ``None`` triggers
            the default.
        title: Human-readable ``annotations.title`` for the tool, used as
            the label by title-aware MCP clients (e.g. VS Code) instead of
            the raw tool name.  Defaults to ``"Server Info"``; pass ``""``
            to register an empty title; only ``None`` triggers the default.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If ``upstream_label`` collides with a reserved payload
            key (``server_name``, ``server_version``, ``core_version``).
