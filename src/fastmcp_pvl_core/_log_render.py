"""Turn a log record into output — the only module that knows the shape.

The family's logging standard writes ``logger.info("event_name key=%s",
value)``. Standard library logging keeps the two halves of that call apart
on the record: ``record.msg`` is the template the developer wrote,
``record.args`` holds the values. :func:`bind_record` recovers a
conforming record's **typed** fields by parsing the template
(``._log_grammar``) and pairing each placeholder with its argument — never
by reading a value back out of rendered text. That is why a value
containing a space, an ``=`` or a quote cannot confuse the result, and why
an ``int`` stays an ``int`` in JSON.

Two renderers consume that binding: :func:`render_rich` for the
``key=value`` text mode, :class:`JsonFormatter` for the one-object-per-line
mode. Both fall back to ``record.getMessage()`` for a non-conforming
record — non-conforming is the normal case for third-party records, and is
never treated as an error.

A log call must never raise because of how it was rendered. ``record.msg``
may be any object, not a ``str``; ``record.args`` may be a ``Mapping``
(stdlib's single-dict ``%(key)s`` form) rather than a tuple; a field value
may not be JSON-serialisable. Each of those degrades to the formatted
message rather than propagating — *within* :func:`render_rich` and
:class:`JsonFormatter` themselves. That alone is not the whole guarantee:
``logging.Formatter.format`` calls ``record.getMessage()`` *before*
``formatMessage`` ever runs, and ``RichHandler.emit`` calls it a second
time on its ``exc_info`` branch — both bypass this module's renderers
entirely, so a ``msg``/``args`` pair that raises out of ``getMessage()``
still reaches the caller as an exception unless something rewrites the
record before either handler runs. :class:`_NeverRaiseFilter` is that
something: attached to every handler
``_logging._install_root_handlers`` installs, it makes ``getMessage()``
safe for *any* subsequent caller — this module's renderers included — by
rewriting an unrenderable record in place before a handler's own
``format``/``emit`` ever touches it. The guarantee holds for the chain
pvl-core installs; a handler an operator attached to root before
:func:`~._logging.configure_logging_from_env` ran, and that this module
tolerates rather than replaces, sees the raw record and is not covered.

One record never conforms to the grammar because it is not ours to
template: uvicorn's ``uvicorn.access`` line. ``_logging._AccessLogFilter``
parses and redacts it anyway, since it is the one place that knows what
uvicorn's fixed template means, and attaches the result to the record as
:class:`_AccessLogFields`. :class:`JsonFormatter` reads that attribute
straight through when present, instead of falling back to ``message`` —
``render_rich`` does not, so Rich mode is unaffected.
