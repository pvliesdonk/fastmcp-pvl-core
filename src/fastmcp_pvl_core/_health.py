"""Unauthenticated liveness and readiness routes.

A container orchestrator probing a pvl-core server has, without this,
nothing better than a TCP connect — which proves a socket is accepting
and nothing else, so a server whose backing store is gone still reports
healthy (issue #313).

Two routes, because the two questions have different answers:

* ``…/health`` — **liveness**. Static, no I/O, ``200`` for as long as the
  process serves. A failure here means restart me.
* ``…/health/ready`` — **readiness**. Runs every registered check and
  answers ``503`` if any fails. A failure here means take me out of
  rotation; it is not a reason to restart, because an unreachable Redis
  is not fixed by killing the process.

Both sit outside the MCP mount and outside auth — that is what a probe
needs, and it is what ``mcp.custom_route`` gives: the MCP endpoint still
answers ``401`` while these answer ``200``.

Path derivation is ours to do. ``custom_route`` registers at the ASGI app
root regardless of where MCP is mounted, so a server mounted under
``/myserver/mcp`` would otherwise publish its health route at the host
root and collide with every sibling sharing that hostname — the same
class of problem as the OAuth discovery route in issue #196. The routes
are therefore derived from the mount path: ``/myserver/mcp`` yields
``/myserver/health``.

            route published at the wrong prefix is worse than none, and

        env_prefix: The server's env-var prefix, used to read
            ``<PREFIX>_HEALTH_DETAIL`` (operator config: ``status`` /
            ``standard`` / ``full``, default ``standard``).

            cannot know whether an upstream API key is still valid or a
            domain index has loaded, so these are the caller's to supply.
