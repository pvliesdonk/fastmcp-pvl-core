"""The ``/transfer/{token}`` HTTP handler (ADR 0001 §3/§8 / §11 #4).

:func:`make_transfer_handler` builds the Starlette handler that drives the
capability-link state machine over HTTP:

- **GET** downloads: claim the token, ``sink.read`` the bytes, serve them with
  an RFC 6266 ``Content-Disposition``, then ``store.complete`` (grace-settle).
- **POST/PUT** uploads: claim the token, read the request body under a
  size cap (aborting early past it), ``sink.write`` it, return the sink's
  payload as JSON, then ``store.complete`` (grace-settle).

The link is **settled on success** (``store.complete`` — grace-settle, so a
served-but-stalled transfer can retry within the grace window rather than be
stranded) and **released on any failure** (``store.release`` — a transient
failure must not spend the link; ADR §6.1). A sink may raise
:class:`TransferSinkError` (or a named subclass) from ``read``/``write`` to
return a specific 4xx/5xx status instead of the default 500; the link is still
released, exactly as on any other failure. The handler is kept internal; the
route-registration layer (§11 issue #5) mounts it via ``mcp.custom_route`` and
wires the operator caps from config.

Intra-package imports stay relative so a fold-in is a directory rename.

        and *it* does not send ``Connection: close``. ``HEAD`` reaches this
