"""SSRF-hardened URL→bytes fetch primitive (ADR 0001 §11 #1).

A standalone, reusable capability: safely pull the bytes at an operator- or
caller-supplied HTTP(S) URL without becoming a server-side request-forgery
vector. Consumed by the transfer ingest plane, but useful anywhere a server
needs to fetch a URL.

Hardening (lifted from ``markdown-vault-mcp``'s proven fetch, ADR §8):

- **Scheme allowlist** — only ``http``/``https`` (fixed shape, not
  configurable; loosening it is an SSRF policy change pvl-core owns).
- **Address validation + DNS-rebind pin** — the host is resolved, *every*
  resolved address is rejected if non-public, and the validated IP is pinned
  into the connection (we dial the IP literal, carrying the real hostname only
  in the ``Host`` header and TLS SNI). This closes the TOCTOU window between
  validation and connect. Fails **closed** on any resolution error.
- **Redirects, revalidated per hop** — redirects are followed, but the guard
  above is not a pre-flight check done once in :func:`fetch_url`; it lives in
  :class:`_GuardedTransport`. httpx sends every redirect hop back through the
  transport, so each hop repeats the scheme check, the address validation, and
  the pin by construction — a ``Location`` pointing at an internal target is
  refused exactly as a directly-supplied one is. httpx bounds the chain
  (``max_redirects``) and drops ``Authorization`` on a cross-origin hop.
- **No ambient environment** — the client runs with ``trust_env=False`` so an
  ``HTTP(S)_PROXY`` env var cannot divert the request past the pinned IP and
  ``.netrc`` cannot attach ambient credentials.
- **Streaming size cap** — the body is read in chunks and aborted the moment it
  exceeds ``max_bytes``; an oversize payload never fully materialises.
- **Credential hygiene** — embedded ``user:pass@`` userinfo is dropped from the
  dialled request (never relayed to the origin), and every URL this primitive
  *itself* emits — its log line and the exceptions it raises, including the
  ``HTTPStatusError`` re-raised on a 4xx/5xx — is redacted of userinfo + query
  via :func:`_redact_url` (ADR §8: redaction covers *all* the emit-paths this
  primitive owns, not only logs). httpx's own internal request logger also
  emits the URL; that is the operator's logging-config concern (pvl-core ships
  ``SecretMaskFilter``), not something a primitive should globally reconfigure.

    unspecified, reserved, benchmarking (198.18/15), and CGNAT / shared address
    space (100.64/10, RFC 6598) are all covered structurally, on IPv4, IPv6,

    decoded here, deliberately: ``ipv4_mapped`` (``::ffff:a.b.c.d``) and 6to4
