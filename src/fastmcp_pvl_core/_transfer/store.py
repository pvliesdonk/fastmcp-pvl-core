"""KV-backed capability-link token store (ADR 0001 §6 / §11 #3).

A ``TransferStore`` persists capability-link tokens over an
:class:`~key_value.aio.protocols.key_value.AsyncKeyValue` backend
(``build_kv_store(config, namespace="transfer")``) and runs an
``available ↔ in_flight`` state machine (plus an explicit ``consumed`` burn) on
them:

- :meth:`TransferStore.mint` creates an ``available`` token whose lifetime is
  the KV entry TTL — there is no sweep loop; an expired token (and any
  abandoned reservation past its TTL) simply vanishes from the backend.
- :meth:`TransferStore.claim` marks a token ``in_flight`` under a short lease.
  A *crashed* handler's reservation auto-frees once the lease lapses, so the
  next claim reclaims it without an explicit release.
- :meth:`TransferStore.release` reverts ``in_flight → available`` on a transient
  failure, keeping the **full remaining TTL** — the link survives for a full
  retry window (ADR §6.1 rejects delete-on-claim; mid-serve failures are common
  and must not spend the link).
- :meth:`TransferStore.complete` grace-settles ``in_flight → available`` on
  success with the TTL shrunk to ``min(remaining, grace_seconds)``. It does
  **not** hard-burn: a transfer whose bytes were served but whose delivery then
  stalled can re-claim within the grace window rather than be stranded by a
  spent link. The ``min`` never extends and does not slide across retries, so
  the absolute expiry is pinned at the first settle.
- :meth:`TransferStore.burn` is the strict-one-shot alternative — it marks the
  token ``consumed`` (a later claim raises ``TokenAlreadyConsumedError``), for a
  caller that cannot tolerate even a grace-window replay.

**Why grace-settle over a hard burn (ADR §6).** The TTL is the
security-relevant bound; strict single-use is *hygiene*. A hard burn on success
spends the link the instant the bytes leave the sink — before they reach the
client — so a download stall or a lost ack strands the caller (the failure
markdown-vault-mcp hit in practice). Shrinking the TTL to a short grace instead
keeps the link briefly reclaimable while still letting normal KV-TTL expiry
remove it, with no sweep loop.

**Correctness boundary (ADR §6.3).** The KV facade exposes no compare-and-set,
so one in-process :class:`asyncio.Lock` serialises every read-modify-write.
Within the single ``serve --transport http`` process these servers run, that
gives exact semantics *and* restart survival (the record lives in KV). A future
horizontally-scaled deployment sharing one backend would degrade to best-effort
— acceptable by design, because the TTL, not strict single-use, is the
security-relevant bound.

The token carries an **opaque ``sink_handle``** (where bytes land) and opaque
``caps`` that the store never interprets — only ``kind`` is matched on claim.
``sink_handle`` and ``caps`` must be JSON-serialisable: they round-trip through
the KV backend. Intra-package imports stay relative so a fold-in is a directory
rename.
