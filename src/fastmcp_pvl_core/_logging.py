"""Logging setup — pvl-core owns the root logger; FastMCP is turned off.

``configure_logging_from_env`` installs a single console handler chain at
the **root** logger and neutralises FastMCP's own logging
(``fastmcp.settings.log_enabled = False``), rather than delegating to
FastMCP's ``configure_logging``. Every logger — ``fastmcp.*`` included —
propagates into that chain instead of rendering through one of its own.
Rendering is chosen once, process-wide, via ``{PREFIX}_LOG_FORMAT``: the
Rich ``event key=value`` pair of handlers, or a single JSON handler with
no separate traceback path (see :func:`_resolve_format`).

Under HTTP transport, a server started through :func:`._serve.run_http`
pins ``log_config=None``, so uvicorn never runs its own ``dictConfig`` and
never reinstalls a handler on ``uvicorn.access``/``uvicorn.error``. Those
loggers stay on the root chain this module installs, so this module is the
sole console owner regardless of transport.

The ``-v`` CLI flag forces ``DEBUG``; otherwise ``<PREFIX>_LOG_LEVEL``
wins, with the legacy ``FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL`` honoured as a deprecated
fallback for one release when ``<PREFIX>_LOG_LEVEL`` is unset; otherwise
``INFO``.

Three mechanisms keep the operator stream readable at both ends:
``_NOISY_THIRD_PARTY_LOGGERS`` (loud at ``INFO``, demoted),
``_DEBUG_FLOOD_LOGGERS`` (loud at ``DEBUG``, capped), and
``_AccessLogFilter`` (``uvicorn.access``, left at ``NOTSET`` so the level
governs whether access lines appear at all, and always installed — at
``DEBUG`` it keeps every status instead of failures only, but it never
stops redacting, since whether a line is worth logging is a preference and
whether a credential may appear in it is not).

This module also exposes :class:`SecretMaskFilter`, a reusable
``logging.Filter`` that redacts ``Authorization: Bearer/Token/Basic``
values in formatted log messages before they reach handlers.

    uvicorn emits every access record at ``INFO`` regardless of status, so
    at the default level the successful ones are pure duplication: the
    request-logging middleware already reports each MCP call with its method
    and duration. What the middleware cannot report is what never reached it
    — a 401 refused by auth, a 404, a 413 — so those stay, and a readiness
    probe becomes visible exactly when it starts failing. Whether a
    successful request deserves a line is a preference: *drop_successes*
    expresses it, and ``_apply_access_policy`` ties it to the level so an
    operator at ``DEBUG`` sees every status.

    Redaction is not a preference and is never conditional on
    *drop_successes* — every record this filter is given gets rewritten,
    kept or not, because uvicorn logs the request line as ``path?query``:

    * the query string goes entirely. No route in this family carries
      diagnostic query parameters; the ones that carry anything are the
      OAuth routes, where it is an authorization code or PKCE material.
    * the segment after ``/transfer/`` is masked, because the transfer token
      is in the *path*. An expired link produces the 4xx this filter always
      keeps; a live one produces a 2xx, visible only at ``DEBUG`` — which is
      exactly why redaction cannot be tied to *drop_successes* either.

    A record of any other shape passes untouched: this filter judges
    uvicorn's access line, and anything else on that logger is not its
    business.

    A record this filter understands and keeps also gets the parsed
    ``client``/``method``/``path``/``status`` attached as
    :class:`~._log_render._AccessLogFields`, under
    :data:`~._log_render._ACCESS_FIELDS_ATTR`. uvicorn owns this record's
    template, so it never conforms to the family's log-call grammar and
    :class:`~._log_render.JsonFormatter` would otherwise have nothing but a
    formatted ``message`` to emit. *path* on that attribute is the same

      ``json`` otherwise (the case that matters is a container). An
      unrecognised value falls back silently, the same way an unknown

    Handler installation at root holds three invariants:

    1. **stderr only.** Nothing this function installs writes to stdout,
       which is the protocol channel under stdio transport.
    2. **Idempotent.** Handlers this function installed are marked and
       removed before reinstalling on every call, so repeated calls leave
       exactly one chain at root.
    3. **Exclusive over the console, tolerant of everything else.** Any
       pre-existing root handler that writes to the console is replaced
       (the double-render source when ``opentelemetry-instrument`` has
       installed one); every other handler — an OTLP ``LoggingHandler``, a
       file handler, a syslog handler — is left untouched. Because
       ``fastmcp.*`` now propagates instead of rendering through its own
       handlers, a handler an operator attached at root also starts
       receiving ``fastmcp.*`` records.

    Three noisy third-party loggers — ``mcp.server.lowlevel.server`` (the MCP
    SDK request line), ``httpx``, and ``httpcore`` — are demoted to
    ``WARNING`` (or the resolved level itself, if that is stricter than
    ``WARNING``) whenever the resolved level is above ``DEBUG``, so their
    per-request chatter stays out of the default ``INFO`` stream without
    ever making them *louder* than the operator's own chosen level. At
    ``DEBUG`` they are reset to ``NOTSET`` and reappear. ``uvicorn.error``
    is never demoted.

    ``uvicorn.access`` (the HTTP access log) is handled differently: a
    level cannot express "failures only", so it is left at ``NOTSET`` —
    inheriting the root level, like any other unconfigured logger — and
    always given a filter that redacts the query string and any
    ``/transfer/<token>`` segment from every request line it sees. The
    filter decides *which* requests are worth a line; the level decides
    *whether* the operator wants request lines at all — raising
    ``{env_prefix}_LOG_LEVEL`` to ``WARNING`` or above silences access lines
    entirely, kept or not, the same way it silences every other logger
    without unique verbosity needs. At every level except ``DEBUG`` the
    filter also drops successful (``< 400``) requests; at ``DEBUG`` every
    status passes, but the redaction never stops — whether a line is worth
    logging is a preference the level and filter both express, whether a
    credential may appear in it is not.

    One third-party logger is capped in the other direction:
    ``docket.worker`` is pinned to ``INFO`` when the resolved level is
    ``DEBUG``, because its poll loop emits a record per iteration even on
    an idle queue and would otherwise dominate the ``DEBUG`` stream. Its
    ``INFO`` lifecycle records are unaffected, and at every other level it
    is left at ``NOTSET`` — the cap only ever removes the poll trace. An
    operator debugging the task queue itself restores the full stream
    after this call with
    ``logging.getLogger("docket.worker").setLevel(logging.DEBUG)``.

    Args:
        env_prefix: Caller-supplied identity, not a pvl-core default — the
            server's own env var prefix (e.g. ``"MY_APP"``), matching

    dict-repr (``'Authorization': 'Token xyz'``) representations,

    ``Bearer`` / ``Token`` / ``Basic`` scheme name. The scheme name's
    original casing is preserved in the redacted output (e.g.
    ``bearer ***``). Records with no match pass through unchanged.

    The filter never suppresses records — it always returns ``True``.
