"""The tool boundary: no exception leaves a tool unclassified.

A tool call ends in one of four outcomes (the ``designing-tool-outcomes``
skill). Three of them are deliberate and the tool raises them itself as a
``ToolError`` with a model-facing message and a ``log_level``. The fourth,
the server failing, is everything else: this module turns it into one
ERROR line with the traceback and a fixed message that tells the model
the request was fine. Without it, the exception reaches FastMCP's own
handler, which logs its own ERROR traceback and, under
``mask_error_details``, drops the reason. The decision and its
alternatives are in ``docs/adr/0005-tool-boundary.md``; how FastMCP and
the MCP SDK treat each case is in
``docs/reference/mcp-tool-outcomes-and-errors.md``.

    A ``FastMCPError`` (``ToolError``, ``ResourceError``, ...) passes through
    unchanged: the tool raised it on purpose, with its own message and
    ``log_level``. So does an ``MCPError`` for a missing client capability,
    which must reach the wire as a protocol error. Any other ``Exception`` is
    logged once at ERROR with its traceback as ``tool_failed`` and replaced
    by a ``ToolError`` carrying :data:`FAULT_MESSAGE`, so the model never
    sees the exception's own text, with or without ``mask_error_details``.
    An upstream rate limit (HTTP 429) or timeout heals itself: it is logged
    at WARNING without a traceback and the ``ToolError`` says to retry, in
    the words FastMCP uses for the same cases. Cancellation and other
    ``BaseException`` subclasses pass through.

    ``functools.wraps`` keeps the signature and annotations, so the input and
    output schemas, ``Context`` injection and ``TaskConfig`` (which needs a
    coroutine function) behave as for *fn* itself. The decorator takes no
    options: the message, the log line and its level are the same decision
    for every server in the family.
