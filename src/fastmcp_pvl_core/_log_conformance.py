"""Find logging calls that do not follow the family log-call grammar.

The grammar in :mod:`._log_grammar` is what turns a log record into fields
rather than a sentence. A call that does not follow it still logs — it just
arrives at an aggregator as an opaque ``message``. This module finds those
calls so a project can fail its build on them instead of discovering them in
production.

It reads source with :mod:`ast` and never imports the tree it scans, so it is
safe to point at a package whose dependencies are not installed.

Kept separate from :mod:`._log_grammar` for separation of concerns: the
grammar is the contract a template either follows or does not, while this
module is a tool built on that contract — a project's build gate, not
something a running server depends on.
