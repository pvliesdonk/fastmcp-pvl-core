"""The family log-call grammar: ``event_name key=value`` templates.

The logging standard every first-party module follows writes
``logger.info("event_name key=%s", value)``. Standard library logging keeps
the two halves of that call apart on the record — ``record.msg`` is the
template the developer wrote, ``record.args`` holds the values — so a
renderer can recover typed fields by parsing the *template* and pairing each
placeholder with its argument. This module owns that parse.

It deliberately never looks at a rendered message. A value is whatever the
caller passed; it is never re-read out of formatted text, so a value
containing a space, an ``=`` or a quote cannot confuse the result.

Non-conforming templates are not an error here. ``parse_log_template``
returns ``None`` and callers fall back to the formatted message — a log call
must never raise because of how its message was phrased.
